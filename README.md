Only works in Two Column Layout (not the skinny layout).

Tested in Unity 2018.2.14 with .NET 4.x scripting runtime. Previous/future versions may or may not work depending on how much Unity changes their code.

### Installation:

Download the two cs files and put them in an Editor folder.

Example: in "Assets/GreatFolderName/AnotherFolder/Editor/"
